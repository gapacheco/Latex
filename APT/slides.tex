	\frametitle{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
 		\item Scholar productivity and success is a topic that has attracted a lot of attention from researchers.
		\vspace{0.3cm}
		
 		\item Our goal is to assess the relative importance of different academic factors, that is, factors directly related to academic productivity, to the scholar popularity.
 		\vspace{0.3cm}
 		
		\item Such knowledge is valuable to individual researchers, as it can help supporting their decisions 
 	to build the career in research
 		\vspace{0.3cm}
 		
 		\item Understanding how different factors impact scholar popularity can also bring insights into the 
 	design of more effective popularity prediction models 		
 			
	\end{itemize}

	 \frametitle{Data Collection}
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and Stanford
	 			
	 	\alert {Some of the best graduate programs of the country according to CAPES}
	 	\vspace{0.3cm}

	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item Webometrics Ranking of World Universities

\frame
{
	\frametitle{Our Strategy}
	\begin{itemize}
		 \item Quantify correlations between popularity and indices of academic productivity
		 	\begin{itemize}
		 		\item Number of student supervisions
		 		\item Number of conference papers
		 		\item Number of journal articles
		 		\item H-index	
		 	\end{itemize}
		 \vspace{0.3cm}
		 		
		 \item Our analyses are performed on a per-scholar basis and aggregated for individual programs, but always 			 		 separately for different areas.
		 \vspace{0.3cm}

\frame
{
	\frametitle{Future Work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Our findings are original and thought-provoking, as cross-area analyses are rarely performed, and provide insights  	 	 	into how to increase research impact for individual scholars and graduate programs. Future work includes covering new  	 	 	 	universities and knowledge areas, tackling self-citations, and designing popularity prediction models.
